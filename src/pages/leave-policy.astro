              The leave policy in HRPayHub is designed to ensure fair,
              transparent, and flexible leave management for all employees.
              Here’s a detailed summary of the key policy settings and their
              functions:
            </p>
            <p>
              ✅ Leave Calendar Year: <br />
              <span
                >Every company must define a start and end date for their leave
                calendar year to ensure consistency in leave calculations.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              ✅ Leave Entitlement Start Date: <br />
              <span
                >Employees’ leave entitlements begin on their resumption or
                confirmation date, as chosen during setup.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              ✅ Annual Leave and Personal Leave: <br />
              <span
                >Annual leave (mandatory) and personal leave (optional)
                entitlements are set as numeric values representing the total
                days allocated for each leave type.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              ✅ Prorated 1st-Year Leave:  <br />
              <span
                >For employees who start mid-year, annual and personal leave
                entitlements are prorated based on their start date (resumption
                or confirmation). If confirmation is pending, the system will
                delay calculation until the date is confirmed.</span
              >
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>
                ✅ Leave Policy Types:  <br />
                <span>Companies can choose between: </span>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Regular: Full leave entitlement is granted upfront.</li>
                <li>
                  Accrual: Leave is earned progressively each month (e.g., 1.67
                  days/month for 20 days/year). <br />
                  This policy applies to both annual and personal leave.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                ✅ Accrual Method: <br />
                <span>Choose between:</span>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>365: Leave accrual spread evenly over 365 days.</li>
                <li>
                  300: Leave earned by October to manage end-of-year staffing
                  better.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                ✅ Tenure-Based Leave Increases: <br />
                <span
                  >There is a default setting for UK pharmacies where employees
                  earn additional leave days based on length of service:
                </span>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>+3 days after 2 years</li>
                <li>+6 days after 5 years</li>
                <li>+7 days after 10 years</li>
                <li>+8 days after 15 years</li>
                <li>+9 days after 20 years</li>
                <li>
                  +10 days after 30 years <br />
                  These bonuses are prorated for part-time staff.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              ✅ Blocked Leave Days:  <br />
              <span
                >Admins can block leave on specific dates (e.g., busy periods
                like December) to ensure sufficient staffing. Weekends and
                public holidays are blocked by default but can be adjusted as
                needed.</span
              >
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>✅ Leave Carryover and Policy Changes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  No Carryover: Unused leave does not carry over to the next
                  calendar year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If switching from Regular to Accrual mid-year, the system
                  starts accruing for the rest of the year based on the formula.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If switching from Accrual to Regular mid-year, the accrued
                  balance is rounded up and converted to regular leave.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              ✅ Accrual Calculations:  <br />
              <span
                >For new joiners, the system automatically calculates the
                prorated 1st-year leave accruals based on the actual days worked
                in that year.
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              🧠 Pro Tip: <br />
              <span
                >HR/Admin should avoid changing leave policies mid-year unless
                absolutely necessary to prevent confusion and ensure smooth
                leave management for employees.</span
              >
